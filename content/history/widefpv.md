The only app providing turn-key solution for recording, processing, and livestreaming directly from DJI HD first-person-view drone goggles. A PWA implemented with Nuxt, with application logic in vanilla ES6. Goggles stream H264 packets over WebUSB. Optics adjustments use Three.js. Realtime chat feature utilizes WebRTC. Livestreaming accomplished via WebCodec, WebSocket, Node/Express, and FFMPEG.

Extensive use of performance tracing. An example of my UI/UX design abilities. Much knowledge gained in realtime application optimization, multi-threaded workflows, and the quirks of audio contexts and media codecs.
